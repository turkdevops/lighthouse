# User Flows in Lighthouse

> Motivation: You want to run Lighthouse on your whole site, not just the landing page.

> Is that checkout form after you add an item to your cart accessible?

> What is the Cumulative Layout Shift of my SPA page transition?

You want Lighthouse on a _flow_, not just a page load.

This document describes how Lighthouse measures flows and offers recommendations on how to structure your own flow measurement with practical examples.

## Flow Building Blocks

Flow measurement in Lighthouse is enabled by three modes: navigations, timespans, and snapshots. Each mode has its own unique use cases, benefits, and limitations. Later, you'll create a flow by combining these three core report types.

### Navigation

Navigation reports analyze a single page load. Navigation is the most common type of report you'll see. In fact, all Lighthouse reports prior to v9 are navigation reports.

#### Benefits

- Provides an overall performance score and all metrics.
- Contains the most advice of all report types (both time-based and state-based audits are available).

#### Limitations

- Cannot analyze form submissions or single page app transitions.
- Cannot analyze user interactions.
- Cannot analyze content that isn't available immediately on page load.

#### Use Cases

- Obtain a Lighthouse Performance score.
- Measure Performance metrics (First Contentful Paint, Largest Contentful Paint, Speed Index, Time to Interactive, Cumulative Layout Shift, Total Blocking Time).
- Assess Progressive Web App capabilities.

#### Code

```js
import {writeFileSync} from 'fs';
import puppeteer from 'puppeteer';
import lighthouse from 'lighthouse';

async function main() {
  const browser = await puppeteer.launch();
  const page = await browser.newPage();
  const flow = await lighthouse.startFlow(page);

  await flow.navigate('https://example.com');
  await browser.close();

  writeFileSync('report.html', flow.generateReport());
}

main();
```

### Timespan

Timespan reports analyze an arbitrary period of time, typically containing user interactions, and have similar use cases to the Performance Panel in DevTools.

#### Benefits

- Provides range-based metrics such as Total Blocking Time and Cumulative Layout Shift.
- Analyzes any period of time, including user interactions or single page app transitions.

#### Limitations

- Does not provide an overall performance score.
- Cannot analyze moment-based performance metrics (e.g. Largest Contentful Paint).
- Cannot analyze state-of-the-page issues (e.g. no Accessibility category)

#### Use Cases

- Measure layout shifts and JavaScript execution time on a series of interactions.
- Discover performance opportunities to improve the experience for long-lived pages and SPAs.

#### Code

```js
import {writeFileSync} from 'fs';
import puppeteer from 'puppeteer';
import lighthouse from 'lighthouse';

async function main() {
  const browser = await puppeteer.launch();
  const page = await browser.newPage();
  await page.goto('https://example.com');
  const flow = await lighthouse.startFlow(page);

  await flow.beginTimespan();
  await page.type('#username', 'lighthouse');
  await page.type('#password', 'L1ghth0useR0cks!');
  await page.click('#login');
  await page.waitForSelector('#dashboard');
  await flow.endTimespan();

  await browser.close();

  writeFileSync('report.html', flow.generateReport());
}

main();
```

### Snapshot

Snapshot reports analyze the page in a particular state, typically after the user has interacted with it, and have similar use cases to the Elements Panel in DevTools.

#### Benefits

- Analyzes the page in its current state.

#### Limitations

- Does not provide an overall performance score or metrics.
- Cannot analyze any issues outside the current DOM (e.g. no network, main-thread, or performance analysis).

#### Use Cases

- Find accessibility issues in single page applications or complex forms.
- Evaluate best practices of menus and UI elements hidden behind interaction.

#### Code

```js
import {writeFileSync} from 'fs';
import puppeteer from 'puppeteer';
import lighthouse from 'lighthouse';

async function main() {
  const browser = await puppeteer.launch();
  const page = await browser.newPage();
  await page.goto('https://example.com');
  const flow = await lighthouse.startFlow(page);

  await page.click('#expand-sidebar');
  await flow.snapshot();

  await browser.close();

  writeFileSync('report.html', flow.generateReport());
}

main();
```

## Creating a Flow

So far we've seen individual Lighthouse modes in action. The true power of flows comes from combining these building blocks into a comprehensive flow to capture the user's entire experience.

### Selecting Boundaries

When mapping a user flow onto the Lighthouse modes, strive for each report to have a narrow focus. This will make debugging much easier when you have issues to fix! Use the following guide when crafting your timespan and snapshot checkpoints.

1. `.navigate` to the URL of interest, proceed to step 2.
2. Are you interacting with the page?
    1. Yes - Proceed to step 3.
    2. No - End your flow.
3. Are you clicking a link?
    1. Yes - Proceed to step 1.
    2. No - Proceed to step 4.
4. `.startTimespan`, proceed to step 5.
5. Has the page or URL changed significantly during the timespan?
    1. Yes - Proceed to step 6.
    2. No - Either wait for a significant change or end your flow.
6. `.stopTimespan`, proceed to step 7.
7. `.snapshot`, proceed to step 2.


The below example codifies a user flow for an ecommerce site where the user navigates to the homepage, searches for a product, and clicks on the detail link.

### Code

```js
import {writeFileSync} from 'fs';
import puppeteer from 'puppeteer';
import * as pptrTestingLibrary from 'pptr-testing-library';
import lighthouse from 'lighthouse';

const {getDocument, queries} = pptrTestingLibrary;

async function search(page) {
  const $document = await getDocument(page);
  const $searchBox = await queries.getByLabelText($document, /type to search/i);
  await $searchBox.type('Xbox Series X');
  await Promise.all([
    $searchBox.press('Enter'),
    page.waitForNavigation({waitUntil: ['load', 'networkidle2']}),
  ]);
}

async function getDetailsHref(page) {
  const $document = await getDocument(page);
  const $link = await queries.getByText($document, /Xbox Series X 1TB Console/);
  return $link.evaluate(node => node.href);
}

async function main() {
  // Setup the browser and Lighthouse.
  const browser = await puppeteer.launch();
  const page = await browser.newPage();
  const flow = await lighthouse.startFlow(page);

  // Phase 1 - Navigate to our landing page.
  await flow.navigate('https://www.bestbuy.com');

  // Phase 2 - Interact with the page and submit the search form.
  await flow.startTimespan();
  await search(page);
  await flow.endTimespan();

  // Phase 3 - Analyze the new state.
  await flow.snapshot();

  // Phase 4 - Navigate to a detail page.
  await flow.navigate(await getDetailsHref(page));

  // Get the comprehensive flow report.
  writeFileSync('report.html', flow.generateReport());

  // Cleanup.
  await browser.close();
}

main();
```

## Tips and Tricks

- Keep timespan recordings _short_ and focused on a single interaction sequence or page transition.
- Use snapshot recordings when a substantial portion of the page content has changed.
- Always wait for transitions and interactions to finish before ending a timespan. `page.waitForSelector`/`page.waitForFunction`/`page.waitForResponse`/`page.waitForTimeout` are your friends here.
